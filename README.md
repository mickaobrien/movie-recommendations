# Movie Recommendations

A simple movie recommendation engine based on audience ratings scraped from all the [Top Movie lists](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/) at [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/). 

The ratings were scraped with [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) and [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and then dumped into a [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/) database.

The demo is built on node.js and is up at [movies.mick.mx](http://movies.mick.mx).
